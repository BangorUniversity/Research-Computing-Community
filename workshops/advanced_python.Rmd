# Multiple Function Arguments

```py
def foo(a, b, c, *args):
    print(args)

foo(1,2,3,4,5,6)

> (4,5,6)
```

```py
def bar(a, b, c, **kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    
bar(1,2,3,name='Aaron',age=31)

> {'name': 'Aaron', 'age': 31}
```

---

# Multiple Function Arguments

- Every function in Python receives a predefined number of arguments if declared normally, like this:

  ```py
  def test_function(first, second, third):
      print(first, second, third)
  
  test_function('a', 'b', 'c')
  
  > a b c
  ```

---

# Multiple Function Arguments

- It is possible to declare functions which receive a variable number of arguments, using the following syntax:

  ```py
  def foo(first, second, third, *the_rest):
      print(f'First: {first}')
      print(f'Second: {second}')
      print(f'Third: {third}')
      print(f'And all the rest as a tuple ... {the_rest}')
      print(f'And all the rest as a list ... {list(the_rest)}')
      
  foo('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
  
  > First: a
  > Second: b
  > Third: c
  > And all the rest as a tuple ... ('d', 'e')
  > And all the rest as a list ... ['d', 'e']
  ```

- The `the_rest` variable is a list of variables, which receives all arguments which were given to the `foo` function after the first 3 arguments.

---

# Multiple Function Arguments

- It is also possible to send functions arguments by keyword.

```py
def foo(first, second, third, **options):

    if options.get("action") == "sum":
        print(f"The sum is: {first + second + third}")

    if options.get("number") == "first":
        print(f"The first number is {first}")

foo(1, 2, 3, action = "sum", number = "first")

> The sum is: 6
> The first number is 1
```

- The `foo` function receives 3 arguments. 

- If an additional `action` argument is received, and it instructs on summing up the numbers, then the sum is printed out. 

- If an additional `number` argument is received, and it instructs on printing the first argument, then the first argument is printed out.

---

# Exception Handling

- Python's solutions to errors are exceptions.

- Traceback?

  ```py
  print(a)
  
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  NameError: name 'a' is not defined
  ```

- Often you do not want exceptions to completely stop the program.

- If a network service went down, you would not want your program to fail and permanently stop.

- We can **catch** errors by using the `try/except` block.

- Most languages provide a mechanism to throw and catch errors.

---

# Exception Handling

- Let's catch an `IndexError` when trying to access items that are not in a list.

```py
try:

  names=['Aaron', 'Beth', 'George']
  
  print(names[4]) # Should throw an error
  
except IndexError:

  # Enters this section when an IndexError is caught
  
  print('An IndexError was caught')
  
print('We can carry on, the program did not stop')

> An IndexError was thrown
> We can carry on, the program did not stop
```

---

# Exception Handling

- Let's catch a `NameError` when trying to access a variable that does not exist.

```py
try:

  print(x)
  
except NameError:

  # Enters this section when an NameError is caught
  
  print('An NameError was caught')
  
print('We can carry on, the program did not stop')

> An NameError was caught
> We can carry on, the program did not stop
```
---

# Exception Handling

- Often an error is thrown but we do not know what kind of error to catch.

```py
try:

  print(x)
  
except Exception:

  # Enters this section when an Exception is caught
  
  print('An Exception was caught')
  
print('We can carry on, the program did not stop')

> An Exception was caught
> We can carry on, the program did not stop
```

- The `Exception` class is the top-level error class.

- All other errors derive from the `Exception` class.

---

# Exception Handling

- You can use the `try/except` syntax for any exception in Python.

- https://docs.python.org/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions

- It is possible to raise an exception manually.

```py
try:

  # Some logic that I do not agree with

  raise Exception('Custom Exception message')
  
except Exception as e:
  
  print(e)
  
> Custom Exception message
```
---

# Exception Handling

- The `finally` block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.

```py
try:

  # Some logic that I do not agree with

  raise Exception('Custom Exception message')
  
except Exception as e:
  
  print(e)

finally:

  print("The 'try except' is finished")

> Custom Exception message
> The 'try except' is finished
```

- Useful for file IO

---

# Exception Handling

- The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.

- The `except` block lets you handle the error.

- The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the `try` and `except` blocks.

---

# Classes and Objects

- Python is an object-oriented programming language.

- Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and functions.

- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity.

- Objects get their variables and functions from classes.

- Classes are essentially a template to create your objects (Blueprint - House).

- To create a class use the `class` keyword.

  ```py
  class MyClass:
      x=5
  ```

- Can use the class named `MyClass` to create objects

  ```py
  obj = MyClass()
  print(obj.x)
  ```

---

# The init Function

- The previous slide demonstrated a very simple class.

- All classes have a function called `__init__()`, which is always executed automatically when the class is being initiated.

```py
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Aaron", 31)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

p2 = Person("Beth", 29)
print(p2.name)
print(p2.age)
```
---

# Object Methods

- Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

```py
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def my_func(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("Aaron", 31)
p1.my_func()

print(dir(cat)) # Very advanced
```

---

# The self Parameter

- The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

- It does not have to be named `self`, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

```py
class Person:
  def __init__(s, name, age):
    s.name = name
    s.age = age

  def my_func(s):
    print("Hello my name is " + s.name)

p1 = Person("Aaron", 31)
p1.my_func()
```

- Prefer `self`.
---

# Modify Object Properties

- You can modify properties on objects

```py
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("Aaron", 31)

print(p1.name)

p1.name="Beth"

print(p1.name)

```
---

# Assertions

- Fall into three categories

  - Precondition
      - A condition must be true at the start of a function for it to work correctly. Example, checking input args.
  
  - Postcondition
      - A condition that the function guarantees is true when it finishes. Example, checking result is valid.
  
  - Invariant
      - A condition that is always true at a particular point inside a piece of code. Example, age can't be negative.

- Extremely useful to ensure your object maintains a valid state (age?).

---

# Getters and Setters

- Avoid `get_` and `set_` methods, not pythonic.

- Use the property decorator.

```py
class Celsius:
    def __init__(self, temperature = 0):
        self._temperature = temperature

    def to_fahrenheit(self):
        return (self.temperature * 1.8) + 32

    @property
    def temperature(self):
        #print("Getting value")
        return self._temperature

    @temperature.setter
    def temperature(self, value):
        if value < -273:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below -273 is not possible")
        #print("Setting value")
        self._temperature = value
```
---

# Getter and Setters

```py
c = Celsius()

print(c.temperature)           # 0
print(c.to_fahrenheit())       # 32

c.temperature = 30
print(c.to_fahrenheit())       # 86

c.temperature = -300
```

- Need to add validation to `__init__` method?

---

# Test-Driven Development Demo

greetings.py
```py
def get_greetings():
    return 'Hello World!'
```

simple_unit_tests.py or main.py (repl.it)

```py
import unittest
import greetings

class GreetingsTests(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_get_greetings(self):
      self.assertEqual(greetings.get_greetings(), 'Hello World!')
    
    def test_something(self):
      self.assertTrue(2<1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

---

# List Comprehension

- List Comprehensions is a very powerful tool.

- Creates a new list based on another list, in a single, readable line.

- For example, let's say we need to create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in a certain sentence. **Demo**

  ```py
  sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  words = sentence.split()
  word_lengths = []
  for word in words:
    word_lengths.append(len(word))
  print(words)
  print(word_lengths)
  ```
  
  ```py
  sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  words = sentence.split()
  word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words]
  print(words)
  print(word_lengths)
  ```

---

# Exercise

- Using a list comprehension, create a new list called `new_list` out of the list `numbers`, which contains only the positive numbers from the list, as integers.

  ```py
  numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]
  new_list = []  # Some logic
  print(new_list)
  
  > [34, 44, 68, 44, 12]
  ```

--

- Solution

  ```py 
  numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]
  newlist = [x for x in numbers if x > 0]
  print(newlist)
  
  > [34, 44, 68, 44, 12]
  
  ```

- List comprehension is popular and people like to display their skills. Simply break the commands down and process them step by step.

---

# File Handling

- Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

- The key function for working with files in Python is the `open()` function.

- The `open()` function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

- There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
  
  - "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading.

  - "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending.

  - "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing.

  - "x" - Create - Creates the specified file.

---

# Open a File

- To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file

**Demo on repl.it**

- Create a new file named `data.txt`

- Add the following code to `main.py`

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt")
  ```
  
- The `open()` function returns a file object, which has a `read()` method for reading the content of the file

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt")
  print(f.read())
  ```
  
  - Return the first 5 characters of the file
  
  ```py
  f = open("data.txt")
  print(f.read(5))
  ```
---

# Read Lines

- By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line

  ```py
  file_data = open("data.txt")
  for line in file_data:
      print(line)
  ```

---

# Close Files

- It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.

- In some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt")
  print(f.readline())
  f.close()
  ```
---

# Write to an existing file

- To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the `open()` function:

  - "a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

  - "w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

---

# Append data

- Add a new line to `data.txt`

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt", "a")
  f.write("\nNow the file has more content!")
  f.close()
  
  # Open and read the file after the appending
  f = open("data.txt", "r")
  print(f.read())
  ```
---

# Overwrite data

- Open the file `data.txt` and overwrite the content.

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt", "w")
  f.write("I have deleted the content!")
  f.close()
  
  # Open and read the file after the appending:
  f = open("data.txt", "r")
  print(f.read())
  ```
---

# Create a new file

- To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

  - "x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists

  - "a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

  - "w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

- Create a file called "data.txt"

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt", "x")
  ```

- Create a new file if it does not exist

  ```py
  f = open("data.txt", "w")
  ```

---

# Delete a file or folder

- To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function

  ```py
  import os
  os.remove("data.txt")
  ```

- To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method

  ```py
  import os
  os.rmdir("test_folder")
  ```
  
    - You can only remove empty folders.

---

# Modules

- Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

- A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

- To create a module just save the code in a file with the extension `.py`.

  - Save this code to a file named `hello.py`

    ```py
    def greeting(name):
      print(f"Hello {name}")
    ```
    
  - Save this code to a file names `main.py`
  
    ```py
    import hello
    
    hello.greeting("Aaron")
    hello.greeting("Beth")
    ```
---

# Modules

-  When using a function from a module, use the syntax: `module_name.function_name`

- The module can contain functions, as already described, but also variables of all types (lists, dictionaries, objects etc)

- Developers often place configuration files in seperate modules.

  - Save this code to `people.py`
  
    ```py
    person_1 = {"name": "Aaron", "age": 31}
    person_2 = {"name": "Beth", "age": 29}
    ```
  
  - Save this code to `main.py`
  
    ```py
    import people
    
    print(people.person_1)
    print(people.person_2)
    ```

---

# Modules (Re-naming)

- You can create an alias when you import a module, by using the `as` keyword:

  ```py
  import people as p
  
  print(p.person_1)
  print(p.person_2)
  ```

- Very common to abbreviate modules

  - `import numpy as np`
  - `import pandas as pd`
  
  - Developers like to type less.

---

# Modules (Built-In)

- There are several built-in modules in Python, which you can import whenever you like.

  ```py
  import platform
  
  x = platform.system()
  print(x)
  
  > Linux
  ```

- https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html

---

# Lambdas

- A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

- A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

- Syntax `lambda arguments : expression`

  - The expression is executed and the result is returned
  
- Examples

  - A lambda function that adds 10 to the number passed in as an argument, and prints the result
  
  ```py
  x = lambda a : a + 10
  print(x(5))
  
  > 15
  ```

---

# Lambdas

- Lambda functions can take any number of arguments

  ```py
  x = lambda a, b : a * b
  print(x(5, 6))
  
  > 30
  ```

- A lambda function that sums argument a, b, and c and print the result

  ```py
  x = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
  print(x(5, 6, 2))
  
  > 13
  ```
  
- A lambda expression is a block of code that can be passed around to execute.

---

# Numpy (Demo)

- NumPy is a module for Python. The name refers to "Numeric Python" or "Numerical Python".

```py
import numpy as np

celsius = [20.1, 20.8, 21.9, 22.5, 22.7, 22.3, 21.8, 21.2, 20.9, 20.1]

C = np.array(celsius)

print(type(C))

print(C)

```

Output: [20.1 20.8 21.9 22.5 22.7 22.3 21.8 21.2 20.9 20.1]

```py
print(C * 9 / 5 + 32)
```

Output: [68.18 69.44 71.42 72.5 72.86 72.14 71.24 70.16 69.62 68.18]

- The array `C` remains unchanged

---

# Numpy Arrays

```py
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])

print(a.shape)
print(b.shape)

print(a[0],a[1])
print(b[0, 1], b[1, 0])
```

---

# Numpy Arrays

```py
a = np.zeros((4,4))   # Create an array of all zeros
print(a)

b = np.ones((2,2))    # Create an array of all ones
print(b)

c = np.full((2,2), 5)  # Create a constant array
print(c)

d = np.eye(3)         # Create a 2x2 identity matrix
print(d)

e = np.random.random((3,3))  # Create an array filled with random values
print(e)
```
---

# Numpy Array Indexing

```py
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]])
b = a[:2, 1:3]

print (a)
print(b)
```

A slice of an array is a view into the same data, so modifying it will modify the original array.

```py
b[0, 0] = 88
print(a[0, 1])
```
---

# Numpy Datatypes

```py
x = np.array([1, 2])   
print(x.dtype) 

x = np.array([1.0, 2.0])   
print(x.dtype)

x = np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.int64)   # Force a particular datatype
print(x.dtype)
```

---

# Numpy Array Math

```py
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], dtype=np.float64)
y = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]], dtype=np.float64)

print(x + y)

print(np.add(x, y))

print(x - y)

print(np.subtract(x, y))

print(x * y)

print(np.multiply(x, y))

print(x / y)

print(np.divide(x, y))

print(np.sqrt(x))
```

---

# Numpy Sum

```py
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

print(np.sum(x))

print(np.sum(x, axis=0))  # Compute sum of each column 

print(np.sum(x, axis=1))  # Compute sum of each row 
```

```py
x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12]])

v = np.array([1, 0, 1])

y = np.empty_like(x) # Create an empty matrix with the same shape as x

for i in range(4):
    y[i, :] = x[i, :] + v

print(y)
```
