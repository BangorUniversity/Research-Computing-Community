# What is a Shell?

.left-column[
  ![shell-layer](images/shell-layer.svg)
]

.right-column[

- A program that provides a user interface for Unix-like operating systems (kernel)

- Its job is to translate the user's commands into operating system instructions

- The operating system starts a shell for each user when they log in or open a terminal window

- Examples of Shells

  - Bourne Family: sh, ash, ksh, **bash**

  - C Family: csh, tcsh

  - Perl Family: perlsh, zoidberg

  - Microsoft Family: cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell
]

---

# Why Bash?

- Installed as the default interactive shell for users on most Linux systems

- The use of **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterfaces does not scale well when delivering instructions to a computer

- Repetitive tasks can be done automatically and quickly

- Sequences of commands can be written into a script, improving the reproducibility of workflows

- Two ways to use Bash: as a user interface and as a programming environment

- Bash will take some time to get familiar with, however, a small number of commands gets you a long way

- Basic Bash knowledge required to use the Supercomputing Wales service

---

# The Working Directory

.pull-left[

- The **working directory** is the directory that the shell is currently looking at

- Data in Unix is organised into files

- Files are organised into directories

- Directories are organised in a tree-like structure called the filesystem

- The filesystem is responsible for managing files and directories

- Absolute vs Relative Paths

- `pwd` Print the working directory

- `tree` Recursively list or display the content of a directory in a tree-like format
]

.pull-right[
  ![file-hierarchy](images/file-hierarchy.svg)

- Shell defaults to the home directory

]

# Filters

A powerful feature in the Shell is the ability to combine commands and programs in new ways.

- `cat` Displays the contents of its inputs

- `head` Displays the first 10 lines of its input

- `tail` Displays the last 10 lines of its input

- `sort` Sorts its input

- `wc` Counts lines, words and characters in its inputs

- `uniq` Report or omit repeated lines

---

# Filters

#### Exercise

- `cat /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `head -n 5 /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `tail -n 5 /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `sort /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `sort -R /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `wc -l /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `uniq /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

---

# Counting words in a file

#### Options

- `wc -l`

- `wc -c`

--

#### Solution

- `wc /tmp/bash/names.txt`

  - 13 13 83 /tmp/bash/names.txt

--

#### Columns

1. Total number of lines in the file

2. Total number of words in the file

3. Total number of bytes in the file (file size)

4. Filename

---

# Sort

#### Challenge

- Apply the sort command to `/tmp/bash/planets.txt`

--

- `sort /tmp/bash/planets.txt`

--

#### Challenge

- Apply the sort command to `/tmp/bash/ages.txt` - numeric sort

--

#### Solution

---

# Sort

#### Challenge

- Use the `sort` command to get the maximum age in `/tmp/bash/ages.txt`

--

#### Solution

- `sort -n /tmp/bash/ages.txt | tail -n 1`

--

#### Challenge

- Use the `sort` command to get the minimum age in `/tmp/bash/ages.txt`

--

#### Solution

- `sort -n /tmp/bash/ages.txt | head -n 1`

---

# Pipelines

The `|` symbol between commands is called a **pipe**. It tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left as input to the command on the right

Best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters)

Task: Build a pipeline to count the number of unique login ids

--

- `cd` Change the working directory to your home directory

--

- `cp /tmp/bash/logins.txt .` Copy sample data to your home directory

--

- `cat logins.txt` View sample data

--

- `cat logins.txt | sort` Sort data

--

- `cat logins.txt | sort | uniq` View unique login ids

--

- `cat logins.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l` Count the number of unique login ids

---

# Redirection of data

Syntax

- `command-1 | command-2` 
  - Use the output from command-1 as input to command-2

- `command > file` 
  - Overwrite/create a file with output from the command

- `command >> file` 
  - Append/create a file with output from the command

- `command < file` 
  - Feed file to command as input

- `cat < file1 > file2` Any ideas?

--

- `cp file1 file2`
    
---

# Redirection of data

#### Exercise

- `echo "Line 1" > data.txt`

- `cat data.txt`

- `echo "Line 2" >> data.txt`

- `cat data.txt`

- `sort /tmp/bash/logins.txt > logins_sorted.txt`

- `cat logins_sorted.txt`

- Save all unique login ids to *unique_logins.txt*?

--

- `cat /tmp/bash/logins.txt | sort | uniq > unique_logins.txt`

- Read the last line of all python files and save to `last_lines.txt`

--

- `tail -n1 *.py > last_lines.txt`

---

# Search

- `grep` Select lines from text files that match simple patterns

- `find` Find files and directories whose names match simple patterns

#### Exercise

- `cat /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `grep -n olive /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `grep -n olives /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `grep -nv olive /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `find . -type d` Find directories in the working directory

- `find . -name '*.txt'` Find all text files in the working directory

- `wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')` Count the lines in all text files

---

# Scripts

- Move commands into script files

- Commands can be either directly entered by the user or read from a file called the shell script

- Scripts may contain commands, variables, loops, functions, conditionals etc.

- `nano test.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  echo "Hello from inside the test.sh file"
  ```

- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` - Ensure script is portable across different UNIX-like operating systems. Known as the shebang.

- `chmod +x test.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./test.sh` or `bash test.sh`

---

# Loops

- Allow us to repeat a command or set of commands for each item in a list

- Key to productivity improvements through automation

- Reduces the amount of code

- `help`

- `nano loop.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  for idx in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  
      echo "Loop Index: ${idx}"
  
  done
  ```
  
- `chmod +x loop.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./loop.sh` or `bash loop.sh`

---

# Loops

Task: Sort names, colours and planets and save results

- `nano filesort.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  for filename in names.txt colours.txt planets.txt; do
  
      sort "${filename}" > "${filename%%.*}_sorted.txt"
  
  done
  ```

- `chmod +x filesort.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./filesort.sh` or `bash filesort.sh`

#### Extract filename without extension

- `${filename%%.*}`

---

# Loops using a dry run

Task: Print the command but do not execute

- `nano dryrun.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  for filename in *.txt; do
  
      echo "uniq ${filename} > ${filename%%.*}_uniq.txt"
      # uniq ${filename} > ${filename%%.*}_uniq.txt
  
  done
  ```
  
- `chmod +x dryrun.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./dryrun.sh` or `bash dryrun.sh`  

- `#` Comment, not code. Purely for documentation.

---

# Command Substitution

- `nano users.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  DATE=`date`
  echo "Date is ${DATE}"
  
  ACTIVE_SESSIONS=`users | wc -w`
  echo "There are ${ACTIVE_SESSIONS} user sessions currently active"
  ```
- `chmod +x users.sh` Convert the file to an executable

- `./users.sh` or `bash users.sh`

- `./users.sh > daily_users.txt` 

---

# Variables

Task: Sum the integers from 1 to 10

- `nano sum.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  sum=0
  
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do
          sum=$((sum+i))
          echo "idx:${i} sum:${sum}"
  done
  
  echo "Total Sum:${sum}"
```

- `chmod +x sum.sh` Convert the file to an executable

- `./sum.sh` or `bash sum.sh` 

- `seq` Print a sequence of numbers, defaults to a step of 1

---

# Conditional Statements

Conditional statements enable you to code decisions into your Bash scripts

- `if` Perform a set of commands if a test is true

- `else` If the test is not true then perform a different set of commands

- `elif` If the previous test returned false perform a different test

- `&&` Perform the **AND** operation

- `||` Perform the **OR** operation

- `case` Choose a set of commands to execute depending on a string matching a particular pattern

---

# if

If a particular test it true, then perform a given set of commands

**Format**

```
if [<test>]; then
  <set of commands>
fi
```

**Examples**

.pull-left[
```bash
i=10
if [ $i -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "$i is greater than 5"
fi

# Numerical comparison
if [ 001 -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "True"
fi
```
]

.pull-right[
```bash
name="Aaron"
if [ $name = "Aaron" ]; then
  echo "Hi Aaron!"
fi

# String comparison
if [ 001 = 1 ]; then
    echo "Hi"
fi
```
]

---

# Arithmetic Comparisons

- `x -eq y` Test identity

- `x -ne y` Test inequality

- `x -lt y` Less than

- `x -gt y` Greater than

- `x -le y` Less than or equal

- `x -ge y` Greater than equal

---

# if else

If the test is not true then perform a different set of commands

**Format**

```bash
if [ <test> ]; then
  <set of commands>
else
  <set of commands>
fi
```

**Examples**


```bash
i=2
if [ $i -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "$i is greater than 5"
else
    echo "$i is less than or equal to 5"
fi
```

---

# if elif else

If the previous test returned false perform a different test

**Format**

```bash
if [ <test1> ]; then
  <set of commands>
elif [ <test2> ]; then
  <set of commands>
else
  <set of commands>
fi
```

**Examples**


```bash
i=20
if [ $i -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "$i is less than 10"
elif [ $i -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "$i is greater than 10."
else
    echo "None of the above tests returned true."
fi

```

---

# AND Operation

Perform the **AND** operation

```bash
name="Aaron"
i=20
if [ $name == "Aaron" ] && [ $i -eq 20 ]; then
    echo "Both conditions returned true."
fi
```
---

# OR Operation

Perform the **OR** operation

```bash
name="Aaron"
i=10
if [ $name == "Aaron" ] || [ $i -eq 20 ]; then
    echo "One of the conditions returned true."
fi
```

---

# Case Statements

Choose a set of commands to execute depending on a string matching a particular pattern

.pull-left[
**Format**

```bash
case <variable> in
<pattern 1>)
  <set of commands>
  ;;
<pattern 2>)
  <set of commands>
  ;;
esac

**Example**

```bash
status="start"
case $status in
start)
    echo "Starting"
    ;;
stop)
    echo "Stopping"
    ;;
restart)
    echo "Restarting"
    ;;
**)
    echo "Unknown status"
    ;;
esac
```
]

---
# Functions

A function is essentially a set of commands that can be called numerous times. It improves the readability of code and avoids writing the same code repeatedly.

.pull-left[
**Format**

```bash
// Multi line
function_name () {
  commands
}

// Single line
function_name () { commands; }
```

]

.pull-right[
**Example**

```bash
hello_world() {
    echo "Hello World!"
}
hello_world

hello() {
    echo "Hello $1!"
}
hello "Aaron"

```
]



---

# Variables Scope

**Global variables** are variables that can be accessed from anywhere in the script regardless of the scope. In Bash, all variables by default are defined as global, even if declared inside the function.

**Local variables** can be declared within the function body with the local keyword and can be used only inside that function. You can have local variables with the same name in different functions.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

x=1
y=2

test_function() {
    local x=3
    y=4
    echo "Inside function: x: $x, y: $y"
}

echo "Before executing function: x: $x, y: $y"
test_function
echo "After executing function: x: $x, y: $y"
```

# Jobs

- Typically when you run a command in the terminal, you have to wait until the 
command finishes before you can enter another one.

- This is called running the command in the **foreground** or a **foreground process**.

  `sleep 5 && echo "Hello World"`

- If a command takes a long time to finish and you want to run another command in 
the meantime you have two options. You can either open up a new terminal and run the 
command or run the command as a **background process**.

- Think of running a **background process** as dispatching the command to the 
operating system and freeing up the terminal.

---

# Jobs

- To run a command as a background process, add `nohup` before the command and the ampersand symbol `&` at the end of the command.

  `nohup sleep 5 && echo "Hello World" &`

- The **job id** and **process id** will be printed to the terminal.

  `[1] 195684`
  
- By default, the example above will print the message "Hello World" to the terminal after 5 seconds. This is less than ideal, especially if we are the middle of writing a complex command to launch. The solution is to capture any error or output messages from the command into a log file.

- To redirect error and output messages, use the ampersand and greater than symbols `&>` following by the name of the log file.
  
  - `nohup sleep 5 && echo "Hello World" &> job.log &`
  
---

# Jobs

- Once we have created a background process we can view its status via the `jobs` command.

  - `jobs -l`
  
- The output includes the job id, process id, job state and the command that started the job.

- If you wanted to bring background process to the foreground you can use the `fg` commands.

  - `fg`
  
- If you have multiple background processes, include `%` and the job id after the `fg` command.

  - `fg %2`
  
- Note: The `jobs` command will only show background processes that are started, running or stopped in the current terminal.
---

# Jobs

#### Exercise 

- Log in into to the compute node at Bangor via JupyterLab.

- Start a Matlab background process.
  
  `nohup matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "disp('Hello World'); exit;" &> matlab.log &`
  
  `[1] 80706`

- Logout using the `exit` command.

- Log back in into to the compute node using the `ssh compute` command.
  
- View the contents of matlab.log using the `cat matlab.log` command.
  
- If you want to stop a background process manually, you can use the `kill` command followed by the job's process id.

  `kill 80706`
