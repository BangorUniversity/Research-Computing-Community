# What is a Shell?

.left-column[
  ![shell-layer](images/shell-layer.svg)
]

.right-column[

- A program that provides a user interface for Unix-like operating systems (kernel)

- Its job is to translate the user's commands into operating system instructions

- The operating system starts a shell for each user when they log in or open a terminal window

- Examples of Shells

  - Bourne Family: sh, ash, ksh, **bash**

  - C Family: csh, tcsh

  - Perl Family: perlsh, zoidberg

  - Microsoft Family: cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell
]

---

# Why GNU Bash?

- Installed as the default interactive shell for users on most Linux and macOS systems

- The use of **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterfaces does not scale well when delivering instructions to a computer

- Repetitive tasks can be done automatically and quickly

- Sequences of commands can be written into a script, improving the reproducibility of workflows

- Two ways to use Bash: as a user interface and as a programming environment

- Bash will take some time to get familiar with, however, a small number of commands gets you a long way

- SCW platform

---
# Option 1: Access a GNU/Linux machine

- Visit https://jupyter.bangor.ac.uk/jupyter/hub/login

- Login using your Bangor University credentials.

- Select the `Terminal` application.

- Type `ssh compute` and hit enter

- Can see last login credentials?
  
  - `Last login: Thu Nov 14 08:33:32 2019 from ssh.ad.bangor.ac.uk`
  
- `$` Presented with a prompt, indicating that the shell is ready to accept input 
---

# Option 2: Access a GNU/Linux machine

- Open an application called 'Putty'

- Host Name : `ssh.bangor.ac.uk`

- Click 'Open'

- Enter your university username and hit enter

- Enter your university password and hit enter

- Type `ssh compute` and hit enter

- Can see last login credentials?
  
  - `Last login: Thu Nov 14 08:33:32 2019 from ssh.ad.bangor.ac.uk`
  
- `$` Presented with a prompt, indicating that the shell is ready to accept input 

#### Summary

Established a connection from your desktop to a remote GNU/Linux machine

# The Working Directory

.pull-left[

- The **working directory** is the directory that the shell is currently looking at

- Data in Unix is organised into files

- Files are organised into directories

- Directories are organised in a tree-like structure called the filesystem

- The filesystem is responsible for managing files and directories

- Absolute vs Relative Paths

- `pwd` Print the working directory

- `tree` Recursively list or display the content of a directory in a tree-like format
]

.pull-right[
  ![file-hierarchy](images/file-hierarchy.svg)

- Shell defaults to the home directory

]

---
# Files and Directories

- `ls -l /tmp/bash` Use long listing format when printing 

- `ls ~` List contents of *your home* directory. `~` denotes your home directory


#### Wildcard

- Metacharacters such as ** * ** and **?** have a special meaning in Unix.

- `ls *.py` Matches zero or more characters in a filename

- `ls ?c` Matches any single character

---

# Filters

A powerful feature in the Shell is the ability to combine commands and programs in new ways.

- `cat` Displays the contents of its inputs

- `head` Displays the first 10 lines of its input

- `tail` Displays the last 10 lines of its input

- `sort` Sorts its input

- `wc` Counts lines, words and characters in its inputs

- `uniq` Report or omit repeated lines

---

# Filters

### Exercise

- `cat /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `head -n 5 /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `tail -n 5 /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `sort /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `sort -R /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `wc -l /tmp/bash/colours.txt`?

- `uniq /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

---

# Counting words in a file

#### Challenge

- Use the `wc` command to count the number of words in `/tmp/bash/names.txt`

#### Options

- `wc -l`

- `wc -c`

--

#### Solution

- `wc /tmp/bash/names.txt`

  - 13 13 83 /tmp/bash/names.txt

--

#### Columns

1. Total number of lines in the file

2. Total number of words in the file

3. Total number of bytes in the file (file size)

4. Filename

---

# Sort

#### Challenge

- Apply the sort command to `/tmp/bash/planets.txt`

--

#### Solution

- `sort /tmp/bash/planets.txt`

--

#### Challenge

- Apply the sort command to `/tmp/bash/ages.txt` - numeric sort

--

#### Solution

- `sort -n /tmp/bash/ages.txt`

---

# Sort

#### Challenge

- Use the `sort` command to get the maximum age in `/tmp/bash/ages.txt`

--

#### Solution

- `sort -n /tmp/bash/ages.txt | tail -n 1`

--

#### Challenge

- Use the `sort` command to get the minimum age in `/tmp/bash/ages.txt`

--

#### Solution

- `sort -n /tmp/bash/ages.txt | head -n 1`

---

# Pipelines

The `|` symbol between commands is called a **pipe**. It tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left as input to the command on the right

Best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters)

Task: Build a pipeline to count the number of unique login ids

--

- `cd` Change the working directory to your home directory

--

- `cp /tmp/bash/logins.txt .` Copy sample data to your home directory

--

- `cat logins.txt` View sample data

--

- `cat logins.txt | sort` Sort data

--

- `cat logins.txt | sort | uniq` View unique login ids

--

- `cat logins.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l` Count the number of unique login ids

---

# Redirection of data

Syntax

- `command-1 | command-2` 
  - Use the output from command-1 as input to command-2

- `command &gt; file` 
  - Overwrite/create a file with output from the command

- `command &gt;&gt; file` 
  - Append/create a file with output from the command

- `command &lt; file` 
  - Feed file to command as input

- `cat &lt; file1 &gt; file2` Any ideas?

--

- `cp file1 file2`
    
---

# Redirection of data

Exercise

- `echo "Line 1" &gt; data.txt`

- `cat data.txt`

- `echo "Line 2" &gt;&gt; data.txt`

- `cat data.txt`

- `sort /tmp/bash/logins.txt &gt; logins_sorted.txt`

- `cat logins_sorted.txt`

- Save all unique login ids to *unique_logins.txt*?

--

- `cat /tmp/bash/logins.txt | sort | uniq &gt; unique_logins.txt`

- Read the last line of all python files and save to `last_lines.txt`

--

- `tail -n1 *.py &gt; last_lines.txt`

---

# Search

- `grep` Select lines from text files that match simple patterns

- `find` Find files and directories whose names match simple patterns

### Exercise

- `cat /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `grep -n olive /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `grep -n olives /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `grep -nv olive /tmp/bash/colours.txt`

- `find . -type d` Find directories in the working directory

- `find . -name '*.txt'` Find all text files in the working directory

- `wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt')` Count the lines in all text files

---

# Scripts

- Move commands into script files

- Commands can be either directly entered by the user or read from a file called the shell script

- Scripts may contain commands, variables, loops, functions, conditionals etc.

- `nano test.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  echo "Hello from inside the test.sh file"
  ```

- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` - Ensure script is portable across different UNIX-like operating systems. Known as the shebang.

- `chmod +x test.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./test.sh` or `bash test.sh`

---

# Loops

- Allow us to repeat a command or set of commands for each item in a list

- Key to productivity improvements through automation

- Reduces the amount of code

- `help`

- `nano loop.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  for idx in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  
      echo "Loop Index: ${idx}"
  
  done
  ```
  
- `chmod +x loop.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./loop.sh` or `bash loop.sh`

---

# Loops

Task: Sort names, colours and planets and save results

- `nano filesort.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  for filename in names.txt colours.txt planets.txt; do
  
      sort "${filename}" &gt; "${filename%%.*}_sorted.txt"
  
  done
  ```

- `chmod +x filesort.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./filesort.sh` or `bash filesort.sh`

#### Extract filename without extension

- `${filename%%.*}`

---

# Loops using a dry run

Task: Print the command but do not execute

- `nano dryrun.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  for filename in *.txt; do
  
      echo "uniq ${filename} &gt; ${filename%%.*}_uniq.txt"
      # uniq ${filename} &gt; ${filename%%.*}_uniq.txt
  
  done
  ```
  
- `chmod +x dryrun.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./dryrun.sh` or `bash dryrun.sh`  

- `#` Comment, not code. Purely for documentation.

---

# Command Substitution

- `nano users.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  DATE=`date`
  echo "Date is ${DATE}"
  
  ACTIVE_SESSIONS=`users | wc -w`
  echo "There are ${ACTIVE_SESSIONS} user sessions currently active"
  ```
- `chmod +x users.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./users.sh` or `bash users.sh`

- `./users.sh &gt; daily_users.txt` 

---

# Variables

Task: Sum the integers from 1 to 10

- `nano sum.sh`

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  
  sum=0
  
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do
          sum=$((sum+i))
          echo "idx:${i} sum:${sum}"
  done
  
  echo "Total Sum:${sum}"
```

- `chmod +x sum.sh` Convert the file to an exectuable

- `./sum.sh` or `bash sum.sh` 

- `seq` Print a sequence of numbers, defaults to a step of 1
